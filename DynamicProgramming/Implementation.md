# How do I know that it is DP ?

Well, to identify that is intuitive to an extent. <newline>

The feel that you get when the dry run of the problem gets stuck at a particular greedy approach and you cant proceed further , it simply hints at the possibility of having a much easier dp variant in itself.  <newline>

Also a really good approach is to look for the fact whether this problem has sub problems of itself, if the greedy work around requires splitting into cases or different situtations after a point in the dry run , look out for the DP states, def, transition etc.
